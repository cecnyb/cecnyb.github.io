                <strong>Sparse Matrix Optimization with Meta-Learning</strong>:

                This project builds on the WACO (Workload-Aware Co-Optimization) model by integrating meta-learning into the training loop to address its limitations. WACO optimizes storage and scheduling to significantly speed up sparse matrix operations, but its performance declines on new hardware due to hardware-dependent labels. Re-training the model on new hardware is costly, limiting its practical usability.
            
                By incorporating meta-learning, this project reduces the re-training time required for adapting WACO to a new machine. The enhanced model achieves strong performance using minimal data: when retrained on just 300 data points, the meta-learning-enhanced WACO outperformed the original WACO model on data from a new machine.

                A convolutional neural network (CNN) was developed to detect melanoma in images of birthmarks. Several approaches were evaluated, and the best performing model used transfer learning by fine-tuning the ConvNeXT
                model. This model reached an accuracy of 0.88 on the test set.

                <strong>Question Answering RAG Model with Llama-2 and Mistral</strong>:

                Developed as part of a group project, this system uses a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline. A website with quotes was scraped and the content was embedded and stored in Pinecone. The accuracy was compared for two different embedding models and two generative models. 
            
                The best-performing configuration combined the intfloat/e5-base embedding model with the Mistral generative model, achieving superior performance to GPT-3.5-turbo despite having approximately 1/4 the number of parameters.

                In this project, a topic modeling system was developed using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) with collapsed Gibbs sampling. This unsupervised method identifies latent semantic structures in data and extracts representative words for specific topics. 
            
                A subset of 3000 documents from the 20 Newsgroups dataset was used, and different numbers of topics were tested. Using the UMass coherence metric, the best results were achieved with 10 topics and hyperparameters α = β = 0.1.

                <strong>Image Classification of Trees from Bark</strong>:

                A convolutional neural network (CNN) was developed to classify trees from 12 species using bark images. The project includes an ablation study to evaluate the impact of key CNN components.
            
                The base model achieved 66% accuracy, which improved to 80% after incorporating improvements. The ablation study identified residual connections, data normalization, and batch normalization as the most impactful factors, while changes to activation functions and early stopping had minimal effect.
            
                Additionally, an in-order vs. out-of-order (ID/OOD) classification task was conducted using bark and coffee bean images. By removing outliers and applying principal component analysis, the model achieved 100% accuracy in distinguishing ID/OOD samples.

                <strong>Non-linear energy optimization in network</strong>: 
                <a href="https://cecnyb.github.io/articles/Planning_of_electricity_production_and_transmission-1.pdf" target="_blank">Read Article</a><br>
                This project aimed to optimize the energy production and transmission in a network consisting of 11 nodes, each containing energy-producing generators, energy-consuming customers, or
                both. The optimization was done to minimize the total energy production while still meeting all power demands. The generators produces two types of power, active and reactive, which must be accounted for.
                The lowest cost solution was 186.29 SEK. Since the problem is non-convex, there is no guarantee that the solution is a global minimum. The code was written in Julia and is included in the appendix.
